# Writing a Stack

Recall that a stack is a last in, first out data structure. This means that the most recently added element is at the top of the stack. A stack must have the following methods:
```java

void push(E element)    //add an element
E pop()                 //remove and return the top element
boolean isEmpty()   
int size()

E peek()                //look at the top element without removing

```


### Your Assignment

Complete the class `Stack.java` using the BasicNode you wrote in class previously. Test that it works by writing a driver.
